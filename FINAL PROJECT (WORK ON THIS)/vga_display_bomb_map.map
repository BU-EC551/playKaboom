      Number with same-slice carry load:         6
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,034 out of   2,278   45%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       604 out of   4,556   13%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,023
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,124 out of   3,023   70%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             328 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
